# Real Speed Typing Test

## This test is called "real" because it doesn't highlight your mistakes the moment you make them (as many online tests do). 
## This is not how it works in real life! You have to notice and fix your mistake yourself! :monocle_face: :nerd_face:

:heavy_check_mark: Written in Python using **tkinter** for graphic interface<br>
:heavy_check_mark: Reads text from a text file so texts can be easily switched<br>
:heavy_check_mark: Results are given in WPM (Words per minute) and CPM (Characters per minute)<br>
:heavy_check_mark: Also counts your mistakes :zipper_mouth_face:
